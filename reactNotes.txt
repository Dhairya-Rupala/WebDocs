React = A javascript library for building user interfaces (frontend)
A component based framework.

In the basic web development, we always try to keep the HTML, JS and CSS files to keep apart, but what
react does is that, it combines some part of all of the files, so that each and every component will
have its own functionality, style and structure.

Each component behaves as the one seperate working part on their own. When we change or update one 
component or a part of the website, the react will rerender it effectively, ny comparing the changes,
it is called diffing. It compares the DOM tree and just render the changes.

In most of the react application there will be a div called with the id equals to the root, in which 
all the react code will go there.

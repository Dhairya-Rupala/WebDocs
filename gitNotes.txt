git is the version control system for software developers, where we can track and manage changes and the versions of the softwares.

For initializing the git repo we have to do like = git init

There are mainly four stages of the git 
1. Untracked 
2. Unmodified 
3. Modified 
4. Staged 

for commiting in the github we have to put the files in the staged area.

> git status = for seeing what are the files we have in the stagging area.
> git add filename = for adding the file in the stagging area.
> git commit -m "Commit message" = for commiting the files

Note : Only add those files in the stagging area which u want to commit only.

> git log = for seeing how many commits we have made the details about them 
> git add . = for adding all teh files in the stagging area

when sometimes we have jumbled some parts and then we want to track back to the last commit of the file.
but the modified file should not be in the stagged area. So for moving the file in the last commit we have to do like 

> git checkout filename = this will revert the filename to the last commit of that file.

for sending the repository on the remote file we have to do it by creating the repo and then copying the 
repo link and then write the git remote add command.
> git remote add origin https://github.com/Dhairya-Rupala/Story.git
> git push -u origin master/branch name = for pushing the files to the directories 

DS_store file stores the data about how the data icons are arranged in the repo, so we do not want to add them into the remote repo.

for removing all the files from the stagging area 
git rm --cached -r .
git rm --cached -r filename

>touch .gitignore
In the .gitignore file when we want to ignore somefile we can write the file name in there.
# = for comments 
*.extension = this will ignore all the files with the given extension 

For clonning the repo in the local system 
git clone URL== when we clone the repo in the local system the git file also comes along,
when we do the git status in the repo we can see the previous commits.
 
> branching and merging 
for creating new branch - >git branch bname
for checking howo many branches we have - >git branch
for switching to another branch >git checkout bname

for merging to the branch A, first switch to the branch A and then
>git merge bnameWeWantToMerge

forking is just like copying the repository in our remote github, and after changing when we do the PR
and if get approved, the main repo will be updated also.

ES = echma script 
JS = interpreted language 

alert("Message") = alerts the message 

DATA TYPES 
string 
numbers 
boolean 

typeof(some data) = returns the datatype of that given data
prompt(Some message) = this generates the alert and the user can enter some data into it.

for decalring the variable,
var varname = some data;
varname can only contain numbers , letters, dollar and underscore

string datatype 
s.length() = size of the string s
s.slice(start,end) = does not include end, and take the string from start.
s.toUpperCase() = returns the upper cased string

All the operators from the cpp will work in the js, also the division operation will directly 
give the float values. Also here the modulo operation can take the float values.

function funcName(){return something;}
Math.floor(some number) = rounding off the number
Math.random() = generate the 16 decimel number bwn 0-0.99999999999
console.log() is used for the debugging purpose mainly

if and else statements are same as cpp in the js
=== => This operator also checks the values and the datatypes 
== => This operator just cheks the value of the variable
!== => not equal to but also cheks the datatypes of the variables

Leap year 
Div by 400 = yes
Div by 100 = no
Div by 4 = yes

var arr = [data1,data2] Here the list can contain any datatypes 
arr[index]
arr.length; = returns the length of the array list
arr.includes(item) = true or false
arr.push(item) = push the item at the end of the array 
arr.pop; = removes the last item from the array 



DOM MANIPULATION 
JS also comes with the same types as the CSS, inline, internal and the external js
for,

Inline js = in the specific html tag, make the attribute named onload="some js code
 snippet" (In the string both the " and ' works)

Also internal js is, in the body we will write the <script type="text/javascript">
</script> tag, and then write the js code, when the browser hits this line it will
run the code.

Also the external js we have to include the <script tag with the src> and link it to 
the js file. 

Always put the css link in the head section and put the js script at the end of the 
body section.


DOM = Document object model interpretes the HTML element and the HTML pages 
as the set of objects that can be manipulated.

In the chrome developer tools we can navigate within the DOM tree by 
doocument.firstElementChild... so on
doocument.lastElementChild 

As soon as we fetched the object that we want we can save it in the variable and
manipulate with it.

obj.innerHTML = some html or text
obj.style.color = some color for changing the text color
document.querySelector("input").click() = this will check the  checkbox or click the 
other input type

Every object in the DOM can have properties and the methods, the properties of the 
object defines how is the object and the methods define what the object can do.

document.querySelector() will give the first matched object
document.querySelectorAll() will give the array of the matched object
document.getEelementsByTagName("some tag") = gives the list of all the tags 
document.getElementsByClassName(class) = gives the list of the all the class matched
document.getEelementById(id) = in one single HTML there lie only one unique id

In the querySelector we can give any type of query and it will fetch the object 

Heiriarchical selector 
parentTag childTag 
tag.class = fetch theh object with the specified tag and also have the class

When we set the values using the queryselector we will set the values as the string

Always make the seperate files, HTML CSS and the JS
document.querySelector().classList = gives the classList of the element 
document.querySelector().classList.add(added class)
document.querySelector().classList.remove(added class)
document.querySelector().classList.toggle(added class) = if there remove, if not add
document.querySelector().innerHTML; gives the innerHTML 
document.querySelector().textContent = this gives the textContent only
document.querySelector().attributes = will give the list of all the attributes 
document.querySelector().getAttribute("attr name") = gives the value of attr
document.querySelector().getAttribute("attr name",attr value)

for adding the event listener to any element, first we have to fetch that 
object and then call the method addEeventListener(eventName,function handling the event)

Also we can do it by also doing like 
object.addEeventListener(event,function(){
    //Method is anonymous method
})


Playing sound with the javascript
var audio = new Audio("songfile");
audio.play();

in the CSS we can specify the background image by 
background-image: url(path of  the image)

this keyword gives the identity of the object that will triiger the event listener.

For creating the js object we have to create them by using the dict type notation.
var obj = {
    name:"some name",
    age:some age,
    langs : [soome langs]
}

for accessing the attributes obj.atr

In the constructor function of js the first letter has to be capitalized.
function Func(name,age){
    this.name=name;
    this.age=age;
    this.doSome = fuction(){
        console.log("Hey boii");
    }
}

var obj1 = new Func(params);
obj1.doSome()

switch(expression){
    case c1:
        action;
        break;
    default:
        action;
        break;
}

We can also add the event listener for the "keypress" event. But in this case we 
are waiting for the keyboard press, so here we do not have to add the event 
listener to the whole keyboard, instead we can add the event listener to the 
whole document. by document.addEeventListener("keypress",response);

For knowing which event has triggered the event listener we can pass the function
parameter event in the callback function 
document.addEeventListener(some event,function(event){

});
when we look into the event we will get whole bunch of properties of that event 
and we can access the attribute by doing event.attr and can perform the specified 
action.
